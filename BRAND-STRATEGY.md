# Nana's Bites — Brand Strategy & Copy

**Brand:** Nana's Bites  
**Owner / Chef:** Farah Ammar  
**Product:** Gourmet bites, desserts, cookies, handcrafted treats  

---

## 1. Brand & Web Analysis

### Current identity
- **Owner-led:** The site centers on "Farah Ammar" as the main name; "Nana's Bites" appears as a product line (e.g. "Nana's Bites – Signature Dumplings").
- **Tone:** Already warm and premium ("Crafting moments of sweetness", "Handcrafted luxury, made with love") but could be sharper and more ownable.
- **Gaps:** The brand name "Nana's Bites" is underused on the homepage; the hero doesn’t clearly link the chef to the brand or stress artisan/handmade enough for a luxury positioning.

### Recommendations
- Lead with **Nana's Bites** as the brand, with **Chef Farah Ammar** as the face and authority.
- Hero: one clear headline, one short tagline, one line of subtext — all scannable on mobile.
- Keep the current elegant, minimal layout; refine copy and visual palette to feel more “sweet luxury” (cookies, desserts, treats) while staying premium.

## 3. Suggested Color Palette

Aligned with cookies, sweets, and light luxury (current purple can stay as accent):

| Role        | Hex       | Use |
|------------|-----------|-----|
| **Cream**  | `#FAF7F2` | Page background, cards |
| **Warm White** | `#FFFBF7` | Hero text area, sections |
| **Dusty Rose** | `#D4A5A5` | CTAs, links, accents |
| **Soft Caramel** | `#C4A77D` | Borders, icons, secondary accent |
| **Deep Plum** | `#4B2A63` | Headlines, nav (keep existing) |
| **Lavender** | `#7A5C8E` | Hover states, badges (keep existing) |
| **Muted Gold** | `#B8956B` | Optional: badges, “Signature” |

**Visual style:** Light, airy, soft shadows; high-end food photography (warm light, natural textures); serif for headlines (e.g. Cormorant Garamond), clean sans for body; plenty of whitespace. Avoid heavy or cold tones.

Use one primary CTA above the fold (e.g. *Explore the Collection* or *Order Now*) and keep secondary CTAs short.

- **Footer:** “Nana's Bites · Crafted by Chef Farah Ammar” or “Nana's Bites. All rights reserved.”
- **Favicon:** Consider a minimal “N” or a small bite/cookie icon in brand colors (e.g. cream + dusty rose or plum).
- **Consistency:** Use the same headline/tagline rhythm on packaging, Instagram bio, and WhatsApp quick replies so the brand feels one cohesive story.
